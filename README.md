## 📌 Project Overview

The Automatic Plant Irrigation System is a microcontroller-based project designed to automate the watering of plants using a soil moisture sensor and Arduino UNO. The system monitors soil moisture in real-time and activates a water pump when needed, conserving water and improving plant health. This solution is ideal for home gardeners, farmers, and urban landscapes, especially in water-scarce regions.
